# Benchmarks (v2022-12-20.1430-goroutine)

### Test rig specs:
 - OS: Linux 5.15.64-1 (Debian 10.2.1-6)
 - CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 3700X 8-Core Processor @ 3600MHz
 - RAM: 64gb DDR4
 
### hashgen benchmarks for all supported modes

| Mode  | h/s |
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| plaintext | 5,506,821 | 
| base64encode | 4,240,048 | 
| crc32 | 4,170,545 | 
| base64decode | 4,162,956 | 
| md5 | 2,751,432 | 
| sha1 | 2,545,714 | 
| sha256 | 1,968,789 | 
| md4 | 1,900,098 | 
| sha512 | 1,592,121 | 
| ntlm | 1,368,783 | 
| bcrypt (MinCost) | 1,277 | 

### Hash generator benchmarks
 - Head to head comparison of different hash generators
 - All testing was performed hashing rockyou.txt (15,053,568 lines) to md5
 - All hashing stdout was written to /dev/null
 - Benchmarks are an average of 5x runtimes

### Results:
| Program  | Time/s | h/s |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| php8.2		| 5.293s | 2,844,052 |
| go (hashgen)	| 5.471s | 2,751,432 |
| mdxfind		| 13.0463s | 1,153,857 |
| Python3.9	| 19.985s | 753,243 |
| bash | 2h+ | N/A |
